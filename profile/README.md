## Hello!
### We are the https://Steam.Design team.
What does SAPIC stand for? Well... It's our old name! It stands for Steam Artwork Profile Image Cropper!
We started as a simple website for cropping Steam profile backgrounds into showcases, and now we've grown to do multiple projects relating to Steam profiles, and image cropping in general!
